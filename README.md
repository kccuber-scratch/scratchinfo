An epic scratch stats website powered by SvelteKit and Vercel.

## Developing
Install the node dependencies through whatever node package manager you like (npm, pnpm, and yarn, or another one if you want to).
Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. Note that I don't use this in production, I build with adapter-vercel
